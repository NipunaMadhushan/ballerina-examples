// rather than PSVI. Allows XM` syntax to be used to construct `xml` values. `xml` type is designed to
// work well for HTML as well as XML. Navigation syntax with XPath-like functionality. Works with `query
// expressions` to provide XQuery FLWOR-like functionality. No up pointers: elements do not have a reference to
// parents or siblings.
