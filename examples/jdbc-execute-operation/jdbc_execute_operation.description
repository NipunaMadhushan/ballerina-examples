// This BBE demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with DDL and
// DML operations. Note that the relevant database driver JAR
// should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency.
// This sample is based on an H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR need to be added to `Ballerina.toml` file.
// For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [JDBC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/) .<br><br>
// This sample is written using H2 2.0.6 and it is recommended to use H2 JAR with versions higher than 2.0.2.
