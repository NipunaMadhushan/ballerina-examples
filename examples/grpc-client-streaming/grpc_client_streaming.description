// The gRPC Server Connector is used to expose gRPC services over HTTP/2.
// This example includes a gRPC client streaming service and a client. The client writes a sequence of messages and sends them to the server.
// Once the client has finished writing the messages, it waits for the server to read them and return a response.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [GRPC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest/).
