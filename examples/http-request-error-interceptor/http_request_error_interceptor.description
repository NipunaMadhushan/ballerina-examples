// A `RequestErrorInterceptor` is used to handle the errors that occurred in the interceptor pipeline execution. 
// When an error is returned from a `RequestInterceptor` service, the interceptor pipeline execution jumps to the
// nearest `RequestErrorInterceptor`. However, if there is no `RequestErrorInterceptor` in the pipeline, then, 
// the error response is returned to the client without executing the actual resource in the target service.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
