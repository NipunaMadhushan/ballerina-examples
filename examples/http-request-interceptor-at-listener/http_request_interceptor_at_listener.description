// The HTTP Listener supports intercepting requests in the request path. It is possible to
// define a `RequestInterceptor` service class with a resource function to execute 
// custom logic and engage with an HTTP Listener. The request will go through the 
// interceptor services before its dispatched to the actual resource in the target 
// service. Interceptors engaged at listener level can only have default path. 
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
