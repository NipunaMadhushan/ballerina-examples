// Through client data binding, the response payload can be accessed directly. The payload type is inferred from the
// contextually-expected type or from the `targetType` argument. A possible payload type out of `string`|`xml`|`json`|
// `map<json>`|`byte[]`|`record`|`record[]` and `http:Response` is expected as return value type.
// When the user expects client data binding to happen, the HTTP error responses (4XX, 5XX) will be categorized
// as an `error` (`http:ClientRequestError`, `http:RemoteServerError`) of the client remote operation.
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
