// Ballerina has concept of "plain data": data that is independent of any specific code operating on the data.
// The network interfaces between programs are based on plain data. It is the opposite of objects, which combine
// data and code. Plain data supports deep copy and deep equality. Plain data supports serialization/deserialization
// without coupling. Key goal of Ballerina is to facilitate programs that work on plain data.
